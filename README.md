# Public Keys

All ajp's public keys.

You can search `AuthorizedKeysFile` in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and add the file directly to it


TODO

There needs to be a better way to manage this. That detects if the git is updated, needs updating, if sshd is running, and of course if the local host is linked. And it should be indicated in misc or systems. Maybe a basic systems template?
